# Sound Machine

![The Fart Machine](./img/PreveiwPic.png)

A fun keyboard based sound machine that makes fart noises. This was a project done for Wes Bos' 30Days of Javascript. This lesson taught how to manipulate the DOM to change classes within the dom and how to select certain parts within a page.

## How To Use
Press any letter on the keyboard to hear a nice fart sound. The 11 year old spirit in you would be proud!

## Future Improvments
- Add library of music notes, cartoon sounds and video game sounds.
- Add toogle switch.
- Toggle switch would display different themed pages to correspond to different sound libraries.

## Authors and Contributing
This was a project done for the [30 days of javascript site](https://javascript30.com/). It started as a drum machine and I expanded on it as a self study excersie.
